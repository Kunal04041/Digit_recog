# Digit Recognition

The Digit Recognition project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately identify handwritten digits from images, a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. Using datasets like MNIST, which contains thousands of labeled digit images employed techniques such as neural networks and image preprocessing to build a robust classification model. The project involved cleaning and normalizing the data, training a convolutional or fully connected neural network, and optimizing it to achieve high accuracy.
